this me attempting to make a smart bookshelf for some reason, my requirements:
1) pull video from devices default camera, then read text from images
2) interpret this text into titles and then search through a library API to find book information
3) parse and store this information in a mini database which includes the information for the book, author and its location on the shelf
4) create the optimal way to organise the books on the shelf based on sorting method and the size of the books and the shelf
5) make this so that it cam be run from a container
potentially implement:
6) add a projector with a search system which will highlight where a chosen book is on the shelf
7) a calibration system to match the projector to the shelf
8) make it hihglight books which dont follow the organisational standard, have this written to be compatible with the calibration
